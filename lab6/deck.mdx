## History of JavaScript and jQuery vs React

```notes
This is from a talk given by Benedikt Meurer

I'm still new to it. I learned JavaScript back in the Spring of 2017. 

It really opened my eyes to how just a few years ago, JavaScript wasn't really talked about that much

ECMAScript is a standard created by Ecma International, it standardized javascript.

Long story short, there were inactive periods where suddenly at the end of them, js grew a lot

Right now, JavaScript is controlled by the TC39 committee. The proposals and code are open source on github, and I think that you can make a proposal today for a feature you want and follow up on it later. 

Why is it important to know this? The community of javascript controls the future of it. It's a committee of people, backed by people from different companies, all working to further javascript.

That's how the ecosystem goes. It'll be important going into the future, where you might see some drama arise.

# Why?

```notes
because what you learn today, will not be what is hot and new in the future.

What makes react so big?

People make things for it, you can pull something off the internet
