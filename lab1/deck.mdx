# NodeJS

```notes
**Node** is a JavaScript runtime, which can be compared to Java. JavaScript has a ton of [different engines] that compiles your code and runs it. Node uses the V8 engine. I don't know of the huge performance differences and it doesn't really matter to us in the context of this class, but it's kinda neat seeing what powers everything under the hood. Sometimes you'll see me (William) using this without any HTML, but don't worry about it for now.
```

# NPM (and Yarn)

```notes
**NPM** is one of the main package managers for JavaScript. We'll be using it mostly, but know that you can mostly interchange NPM and [Yarn]. You can install yarn from its direct competition, npm. Or you can download it from yarn's website. You'll see people use one or the other if you watch youtube tutorials. Doesn't really matter too much. The packages usually are up to date on both package managers.
```

# Live-server

```notes
**live-server** is a package that runs a little development server in the directory you started it on. It allows for live reload. You will be using it for the first few things, but eventually will not be needing this.
